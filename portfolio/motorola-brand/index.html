          <h2>OUR CORE<br/>CREATIVE IDEA</h2>
          <h5>It's bold.<br/>That's why we chose it.<br/>It has power and clarity<br/>and optimism.</h5>
          
          <div class="column">
          	<p>It's multifaceted, which makes it relevant to our full range of objectives and audiences, now and for years to come.</p>
          	<p>Part of why it's so powerful is that it takes what could be seen as a negative—that nothing's happening—and turns it on its head to make an attention-getting statement about the power peace and safety.</p></div>
          <div class="column"><h5 class="font-black">As you start to use this idea, it's critical to remember:</h5>
          						<ul>
                                	<li>This isn't an idea about what didn't happen. And it's not an idea about nothing. It's an idea that celebrates everything that can.</li>
                                    <li>It captures attention by taking a commonly held expression—that nothing happened—and twisting it as a positive.</li>
                                </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="column column-last">
          						<ul>
                                	<li>It celebrates the result of our work—peace as a powerfully exciting foundation for creative, joyful, thriving cities—instead of lingering on fear.</li>
                                    <li>It merges the power of human function with critical intelligence and shows our audiences as heroes and partners in peace and safety.</li>
                                    <li>It ties directly to our Purpose by focusing on what the work we do makes possible in the moments that matter to everyone.</li>

               <h5>THE SINGLE DRIVING CONCEPT FOR OUR COMMUNICATIONS AT EVERY LEVEL</h5>
               <p>It brings our Purpose to life through the lens of public safety, galvanizing our customers with vivid portrayals of safer cities as the foundation for a more peaceful, joyful, creative, entrepreneurial world.</p>
               <p>It's also the DNA for all our messaging—from how we write sales and presentation copy to how we design our trade booth experiences.</p>

          <h3 class="column-title font-red no-wrap">THE CORE IDEA IS NOT:</h3>
          		<h5>A TAGLINE.</h5>
          		<p>A tagline is a single line created for public use, usually displayed in conjunction with a logo. It's like the core idea in that it represents an organization's reason for being or point of view; it's unlike our core idea in that it never changes. No one at Nike, for instance, would ever consider something like “Go on” instead of “Just do it” as an appropriate pairing with their logo on a billboard.</p>
                <p>Motorola Solutions does not have a tagline, and the core idea should never be paired with our logo.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="column column-last">
          <h3 class="column-title collapse-item"></h3>
          		<h5>A COMMERCIAL CAMPAIGN.</h5>
          		<p>Campaign lines are also external and designed to last for a limited time—often just 3–6 months—with a limited purpose, usually to get people excited about a new product. Our big idea is absolutely intended to get people excited, but because it captures the essence of the new Motorola Solutions, we plan on it being in use for quite a long time, and having the ability to extend for years to come.</p>
                <h5>A HEADLINE.</h5>
          		<p>We want the big idea to stay big. Headlines in brochures, web pages, banner ads, and/or subject lines in emails are great places to evoke the spirit of our big idea, but not to repeat it over and over.</p>

It's this dedication and insight that led to transformative inventions like 1938's two-way radio, and it's this ability to connect dots others don't even see that will lead to our next breakthroughs.</p>

           <div class="column column-offset-sm2 extra-right-margin">
           	    <h5>The idea is constructed using TWO THEMES: one focused on us at work, and one focused on the result of our work.</h5>
               <h5>Messages can focus on either part individually or on both together, depending on your messaging goals.</h5>
           </div>
           <div class="column">
               <h3 class="no-margin">WHEN NOTHING HAPPENS,</h3>
               <h5 class="no-margin">= Us at work.</h5>
               <p>Once the core idea has been seeded and the focus on the freedom and exuberance of a thriving, safe community has been fully established, we can start to work with this theme. Messages in this theme focus squarely on the work we do, showing and telling how we prevent disasters from happening in a range of ways.</p>
               <h3 class="no-margin">EVERYTHING ELSE CAN</h3>
               <h5 class="no-margin">= The results of our work.</h5>
               <p>A celebration of the power of peace. Messages in this theme talk about and show a state of safety and security in which citizens trust police and governments, enabling economic development to flourish and communities to thrive. Our creative expression here should feel joyful, bright and exuberant without being silly or losing the gravitas of who we are.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="column margin-left-75 column-last">
              <h5 class="no-margin">The complete core idea.</h5>
              <p>This articulation gives our customers a peek behind the scenes, linking the work we do directly to the creation of that state of safety. Because it invokes the possibility of disasters and then becomes a celebration of how we help avert them, this is our most powerful statement—which is why it's our core idea. This messaging idea should be used in high-level presentations, to create maximum drama, or in places where supporting contextual materials (sidebars on a web page, for example) ensure that the full idea comes across.</p>

                <p>2. Remember to look for the good, too. We are celebrating everything that's happening because of the dangers and disasters we're preventing. Think about all the ways that communities, and the people in them, are thriving.</p>

			<h5>KEY INFORMATION FROM THE APX PERSONNEL ACCOUNTABILITY APPLICATION SOLUTION BRIEF</h5>

            <p>Today's accountability solutions don't adequately organize the onslaught of information, limiting the effectiveness of any incident commander. Working with public safety agencies, we've designed an integrated solution that addresses these shortfalls, provides a cohesive report and improves responder safety. Better roll call integration, and integrated graphical user interface (GUI) and Personnel Accountability Reports (PAR) timers based on when agencies arrive on scene were key capabilities that incident commanders were seeking.</p>

                    <p>How the APX P25 Personnel Accountability Application
saves those who save us</p>
                    <p>When a 6:30am fire swept through a four-unit condominium in Alsip, residents had already been evacuated. But the danger was far from over. Firefighters battled a building-threatening blaze in between floors and under the roof, risking their lives to save residents' homes as waterlogged trusses sagged beneath them and roaring flames made hearing nearly impossible. Outside, incident commanders used the Motorola Solutions APX P25 Personnel Accountability Application's single, simple interface to monitor who was where, whose oxygen tanks were running low—and then, with the touch of a button, to let everyone know when it was time to get out.</p>
                    <p>Because the accountability solution allows for simultaneous alert and acknowledgement of the evacuation, there was no need to use an air horn apparatus or wait for a manual personnel check. Firefighters hit their PTT buttons and exited faster than ever before—allowing them to fight fires longer, better, faster and more safely.</p>

                    <p>Note: This story is completely accurate, as all our stories must be. Our products, services and solutions speak for themselves, and the world of public safety and first response is inherently dramatic. As long as we keep an eye out for the right moments and use our core creative idea to talk about them in terms of what's at stake for everyone involved, even our simplest stories can be exciting—and we'll be strengthening our brand.</p>

               <p>The only words on any slide should be a concise summary of your main ideas. Let that single idea stay on the slide while you expand into two or three talking points at most.</p>

                <li>Case studies are the next level down. These are individual stories of specific moments in which our technologies and services are transforming safety. While they're focused on individual services, solutions or products, they always tie those things to the larger benefits.</li>

                <li>Use screen wipes, starbursts or other built-in video effects. Shots can move cleanly from one to another without embellishment.

                <li>Especially for event videos, don't film in front of complicated backgrounds or move the camera around.</li>
                <li>Humor is never appropriate, especially for external communications. We deal with sensitive subject matter, and humor is not part of our personality.</li>
