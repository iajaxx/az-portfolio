        	<h2>Mini Case Studies</h2>
            <h3><span style="font-family: 'Open Sans Bold';">Personal Narrative:</span> I collaborate extremely well with design agencies, while also having the ability to complete visual designs and code full experiences as a resident employee. This offers an increase in quality and cycle time by having the expertise in-house. I can be included at any level of the design and development process - planning, wireframing, visual designs, front-end development, quality assurance, integration. I am specialized within the <span style="font-family: 'Open Sans Bold';">Adobe Experience Manager (AEM)</span> Front-end development architecture space.<br><br>
            Site design represents the brand through the use of color, typography, photography and clickable elements. Visual creativity within a site or sub-brands brings forth an <span style="font-family: 'Open Sans Bold';">appealing experience</span>. A cohesive design system enables this creativity throughout without losing structure.</h3>

            <h4>Mini Case Study 1. Streamlined &amp; Reusable Component Architecture</h4>
            <p>Components are architected to be completely reusable from the beginning. Starting with the planning and wireframing stage, the question on reusability is asked up front. The component is then plugged into the larger AEM front-end architecture which is rendered as the UI Build. The UI build is used for all subsequent steps in the build process - quality assurance and then finally AEM integration / AEM component design. I take everything into account while designing the front-end as I am involved in the integration / development architecture on the back-end as well.</p>

            <h4>Mini Case Study 2. AEM Component Design Refresh</h4>
            <p>A single component contains standard styling as shown on the left. A marketer had worked with a design agency to refresh the look of standard components to elevate the style while keeping within brand standards. I worked closely with the agency to provide guidance around the code structures and branding. The standard components were extended with new styling throughout as shown to the right and below.</p>

            <h4>Mini Case Study 3. Design System Refresh</h4>
            <p>One of the first elements a design agency looks for is the design system that may already be in place. The design system gives way to the frameworks and UI elements. It flows through all templates and brings continuity between sites and pages. I developed and streamlined the design system to extended to design agencies. There are also an array of templates as starter frameworks for design agencies. The feedback regarding organization and clarity has been extremely positive from all involved.</p>

            <hr>
            <h4>Mini Case Study 4. Brand / Playbook Site Refresh</h4>
            <p>Brought forth a new brand site experience in 4 weeks. Design agency kickoff meetings began, shortly thereafter design samples were in hand 1 week later. Implemented the unique opportunity to have the agency build the site directly within AEM while following the wireframes and visual designs. I trained the design agency front-end development team to use the very well-architected reusable components. The design agency was able to complete the work in 2 weeks. The deployment saw a successful launch. The design agency was extremely happy with the assets provided and to work directly with me throughout the whole process.</p>
